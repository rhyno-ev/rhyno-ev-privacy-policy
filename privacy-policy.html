            <h3>4.1 Third-Party Agents:</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to engage third-party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and collaborative partners to perform specific functions on our behalf. These entities are bound by contractual obligations to maintain the confidentiality and security of data. Access to user data is limited to what is essential for providing critical services associated with our applications.</p>
            
            <h3>4.2 Emergency Scenarios:</h3>
            <p>In exceptional circumstances, we may find it necessary to disclose your personal information to comply with legal requirements or respond to emergent situations that require the protection of our rights, property, safety, or the well-being of our user community.</p>
            
            <h3>4.3 Referral Program:</h3>
            <p>If you participate in our referral program, we may share the names and email addresses of your referrals solely for the purpose of sending one-time invitations as part of the program through email or other digital communication platforms.</p>

            <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
            <p>We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect your personal information during data transmission. However, it is essential to acknowledge that no method of data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. Therefore, we recommend using our Services with awareness of this inherent limitation.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Transfer</h2>
            <p>By using our Services, you explicitly consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your data in India or other countries where Rhyno or its affiliates operate. We exercise due diligence to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information during data transfer, storage, and processing.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Links to Third-Party Applications</h2>
            <p>It is crucial to note that our Policy exclusively governs data collected by Rhyno. We expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices and data management procedures associated with third-party applications that may be accessed or linked through our Services.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
            <p>In alignment with the evolution and refinement of our Services, we reserve the right to periodically update and amend this Policy to accurately reflect changes in our data management practices. Any such modifications will be publicly disclosed on our platforms. It is your responsibility as a user to routinely review this Policy to remain informed about how we collect, use, and protect your data.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Your Options and Opt-Out</h2>
            <p>You, as a user, retain the inherent right to modify and customise your communication preferences within the bounds of your account profile. While the omission of certain data may be exercised as a discretionary choice, it is incumbent upon users to recognize that such action may result in limitations or restrictions on access to specific features and functionalities.</p>
            
            <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
            <p>For questions, concerns, or clarifications regarding this Policy, we encourage users to contact us via email at <a href="mailto:info@rhyno.in">info@rhyno.in</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>11. Legal Compliance</h2>
            <p>Our Services are rooted in the jurisdiction of India, and as such, we steadfastly adhere to all relevant local data protection laws and consumer rights regulations. Users located outside India are strongly encouraged to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the compatibility of our privacy practices with the prevailing regional privacy laws in their respective jurisdictions before providing any personal information to Rhyno.</p>
            
            <h2>12. Assignment</h2>
            <p>In the hypothetical scenario of corporate transformations or asset transfers, we retain the discretion to transmit your data to a Rhyno entity that assumes ownership of our assets or engages in a merger with our corporate structure. We expect such entities to endorse and adhere to the principles outlined in this privacy statement.</p>
            
            <h2>13. Opt-Out Possibilities</h2>
            <p>While it may not be feasible to completely eliminate data collection during the use of our Applications, users maintain the capacity to limit the extent to which their personally identifiable information is collected, used, and shared. It is crucial to underscore that all disclosures of personally identifiable information are undertaken voluntarily. However, users must exercise due diligence in recognizing that the voluntary omission of certain information may inadvertently impede or restrict access to specific features and functionalities.</p>
            
            <h2>14. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>We actively employ cookies and employ other tracking technologies for multifarious purposes, including but not limited to user identification, analytics, and advertising. User preferences with regard to cookies can be managed within browser settings. It is important to note that altering these settings may affect the ability to access specific features and functionalities of our Services.</p>
